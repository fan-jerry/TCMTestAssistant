Our site aims to build a Chinese-English repository of classic Chinese medicine literature, offer exam tutoring for Chinese medicine and acupuncture, and create a practical acupuncture quick - reference guide. 
1. Establish a bilingual (Chinese-English) repository of classic Chinese medicine literature, making ancient wisdom and modern research accessible to both domestic and international learners, and facilitating cross-cultural exchange and understanding of traditional Chinese medicine.
2. Provide specialized tutoring for acupuncture exams, offering systematic course materials, practice questions, and expert guidance to help candidates master the theoretical knowledge and practical skills required for acupuncture examinations.
3. Offer comprehensive coaching for Chinese medicine exams, covering a wide range of topics, from basic theories to clinical applications, to assist students in achieving excellent results in various Chinese medicine certification and licensing examinations.
4. Develop a practical acupuncture quick-reference tool, presenting key acupuncture points, techniques, and common treatment methods in an easy-to-understand and convenient format, serving as a handy resource for both students and professionals in daily study and practice.
Next, I will provide a detailed tutorial on the process of implementing this website using AI.
